# CASA00025 Group Project: Cranes in Transit

## Project Summary

This project visualizes seasonal habitat use of the migratory White-naped Crane across East Asia. By integrating GPS tracking data with environmental indicators such as vegetation, temperature, pollution, and water availability, the application identifies critical hotspots and evaluates their ecological quality. Designed for conservation practitioners, the tool supports science-based advocacy by enabling users to generate evidence that informs policy and habitat protection. Built on Google Earth Engine, it offers an accessible, interactive interface to explore temporal patterns and argue for conservation priorities at regional and national levels.

### Problem Statement

Migratory species like the White-naped Crane (Grus vipio) rely on multiple seasonal habitats across East Asia for survival. However, many of these areas—especially temporary stopover sites—are under threat from agricultural expansion, urban development, and climate variability (Wilcove and Wikelski, 2008). These habitats often fall outside existing protected areas and are ecologically important only during specific time windows. Because such spatiotemporal dynamics are difficult to observe and document, conservationists face challenges in presenting compelling scientific evidence that justifies habitat protection (Yanco et al., 2024; Runge et al., 2014).

### End User

Our application is designed for conservationists and environmental NGOs who seek to protect migratory bird habitats. These users often struggle to communicate the ecological significance of dynamic, short-lived stopover areas to government bodies. By combining animal movement data with seasonal environmental indicators, our tool enables users to extract spatial evidence that supports conservation claims. This helps bridge the gap between scientific data and policy advocacy, empowering practitioners to argue more effectively for new or extended habitat protections (Rose et al., 2018).

### Data

We integrate multi-source remote sensing and ecological tracking datasets. White-naped Crane movement data comes from the “White-naped Crane Mongolia WSCC” study (Batbayar et al., 2024), which provides high-resolution GPS data via the Movebank Repository. Environmental conditions are assessed using MODIS NDVI for vegetation, ERA5 for temperature, Sentinel-5P for pollution levels, and GLCF for inland water extent. Nature reserve boundaries are sourced from the Protected Planet database, which provides information of protected areas under global standards. Together, these datasets allow us to quantify the environmental quality of crane habitats across space and time (Turner et al., 2003).

### Methodology

We detect crane hotspots by applying Gaussian kernel smoothing to GPS tracking points, generating a density surface (Yanco et al., 2024). Hotspots are selected above a user-defined percentile threshold. Each hotspot is enriched with seasonal environmental metrics—NDVI, temperature, NO₂, and water presence—based on remote sensing datasets from 2018–2021 (Turner et al., 2003). We also check for overlap with protected areas. This approach links habitat quality with crane movement to support evidence-based conservation planning (Runge et al., 2014).

### Interface

Built on Google Earth Engine, the application provides an interactive platform for conservationists without coding skills (Rose et al., 2018). Users can filter crane hotspots by country or province, adjust density thresholds, and click to view seasonal environmental summaries. Layers for vegetation, temperature, pollution, and water fraction are displayed contextually (Collen et al., 2013). Simple controls and clear outputs help users translate complex spatiotemporal data into advocacy evidence to promote habitat protection.

## How it Works

Use this section to explain how your application works using code blocks and text explanations (no more than 500 words excluding code):

``` js
Map.setCenter(35.51898, 33.90153, 15);

Map.setOptions("satellite");

var aoi = ee.Geometry.Point(35.51898, 33.90153).buffer(3000);
```

You can include images:

and math: $$ \Large t = {\frac{\overline{x_1}-\overline{x_2}} {\sqrt{\frac{s^2_1}{n_1} + \frac{s^2_2}{n_2}}}} $$
